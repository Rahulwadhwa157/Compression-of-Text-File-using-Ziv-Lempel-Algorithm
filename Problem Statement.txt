Here goes the first assignment. This is a real life problem used everywhere. The attached text (first chapter from 'The Master and Margarita' ) needs to be compressed using the universal compression method as presented by Ziv and Lempel.

Here, there are different symbols used in this text and there is no probabilistic structure available. You have to make your dictionary and then assign codewords for different variable length symbol strings. Then using that dictionary you have to encode the data.

Store the compressed data in a text file. Find the compression ratio.

Next, start with the compressed text. Build the dictionary again from the compressed text. Then decode the entire text.



P.S: Only information the decoder can know about the encoder is the size of the dictionary, i.e, how many code-words can be stored in the dictionary.  It is your choice.
