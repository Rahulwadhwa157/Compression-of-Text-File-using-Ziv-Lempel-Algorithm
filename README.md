# Compression-of-Text-File-using-Ziv-Lempel-Algorithm

•Implemented LZ77 Compression Algorithm on a Text file and achieved a compression ratio of 0.33.
•Optimized it with a very Efficient String matching Algorithm KMP and able to compress a very large Text file within fraction of a
second.
•Efficiently Implemented Decoding Algorithm on Compressed version and been able to retrieve exact copy of Compressed file.
